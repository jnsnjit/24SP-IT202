// what is SQL --> server query library
imagine a table/spreadsheet with all of the data you want to store
most tables will have a unique identifer for each row
rememeber foriegn and primary keys! (keys can only be ints up to 11 integers)
prices will take up to ten values + two for decimal places

DB Operations:      SQL
C - CREATE          INSERT 
R - READ            SELECT
U - UPDATE
D - DELETE

SELECT * FROM table-1
[WHERE selection-criteria]
[ORDER BY column-1 [ASC|DESC]]
          ,column-1 [ASC|DESC]]...]

select --> pick
insert --> create
where --> if
order --> order by
update/delete/set --> will change values in the table (ALWAYS REMEMEBER TO USE A IF WITH THESE)

for database to work --> website needs
name
port
database name
username
password
